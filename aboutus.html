                <p class="lead text-center">Chris and Vivian Tai, the owners of Computer Adventures - Bits, Bytes &amp; Bots Westchester, have lived with their three children in the Westchester county since 1999. Being conscientious parents, Chris and Vivian are constantly looking for ways to enrich their children’s educational experiences. They were looking for fun technology classes that teach conceptualization, design, creativity and problem-solving. When they did not find what they were looking for, they started their own business that provides the technology education that they were looking for. With their technical and management skills, their passions for technology and children education, and a proven curriculum set, they created Computer Adventures LLC to serve the Westchester county in New York.</p>

		<h1>The Computer Adventures Difference</h1>
		<p class="lead">We teach!</p>
		<p>Many computer classes use a computer-based curriculum. We believe that children learn best when taught by teachers. Our classes encourage interaction among students and teachers, and foster friendships, while allowing the students to move at their own speed.</p> 
		<p>Our teachers are background checked for your children’s safety and are professionally trained. We hire the best teachers who have experiences with teaching children, an aptitude for technology, and share our philosophy that the best way to learn is through FUN!</p>
